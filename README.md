## Digital Twin:

The I4C robotic cell (Industry 4.0 Cell) uses, among other things, my own tool for controlling and programming robotic dynamic simulations (digital twins), more precisely the Unity3D tool with the advanced physics module NVIDIA PhysX.

The Unity3D tool is an important part of the design of the entire solution for the creation of digital twins, which is used to simulate individual devices, test their own algorithms, detect collisions, etc.

The digital twin includes both real device control and simulation control, object manipulation, collision detection, as well as full connection to the control system via OPC UA communication, connection to an industrial/collaborating robot, TCP/IP and UDP communication, as well as performance optimization via multithreaded programming.

# Industry 4.0 Cell (i4C) - Robotic cell according to the Industry 4.0 Concept

The first phase of the project deals with the design of a robotic cell in the context of Industry 4.0 and implementation at the Institute of Automation and Computer Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Brno University of Technology. The main part of this phase of the project is focused on the construction of the cell, which complements the part of advanced system integration, human-machine interface, tools for the simulation of robots as dynamic systems (Digital-Twin), and the use of augmented/virtual reality.

The next phase and future of the project is the development of advanced functionalities in the field of robotics, artificial intelligence, machine vision, etc., aimed at improving robotic tasks such as flexible production, intelligent sorting and machine handling. Another part of this phase will be the expansion of the cell with various devices (robots, PLCs, cameras, etc.) and the improvement of system integration.

The main idea of the i4C (Industry 4.0 Cell) project is adaptability to future automation technologies in various fields, improving literacy (understanding robotics) and helping students (future engineers/scientists, etc.) to create a better future.

## Digital Twin and Augmented Reality:

The I4C robotic cell (Industry 4.0 Cell) uses, among other things, my own tool for controlling and programming robotic dynamic simulations (digital twins), more precisely the Unity3D tool with the advanced physics module NVIDIA PhysX.

The Unity3D tool is an important part of the design of the entire solution for the creation of digital twins, which is used to simulate individual devices, test their own algorithms, detect collisions, etc.

The digital twin includes both real device control and simulation control, object manipulation, collision detection, as well as full connection to the control system via OPC UA communication, connection to an industrial/collaborating robot, TCP/IP and UDP communication, as well as performance optimization via multithreaded programming.

The principle of Augmented Reality (AR) consists in detecting a key object (in our case a QR code), which after successful localization, displays the 3D model on the screen of the mobile phone, tablet or computer together with the control panel of the object.
